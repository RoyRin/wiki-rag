       " 'text': 'Sing 2 is a 2021 American animated jukebox musical comedy film produced by Universal Pictures and Illumination, and distributed by Universal. The sequel to \"Sing\" (2016), it was written and directed by Garth Jennings, co-directed by Christophe Lourdelet, and produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy. The story follows Buster Moon and his group putting on a show in Redshore City while working to impress an entertainment mogul and enlist a reclusive rock star to perform with the group.\\nThe film stars an ensemble voice cast consisting of Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, Taron Egerton, Tori Kelly, Nick Kroll, Jennings, Peter Serafinowicz, Jennifer Saunders, and Nick Offerman, reprising their roles from the first film. The sequel also features new characters voiced by Bobby Cannavale, Bono, Halsey, Pharrell Williams, Chelsea Peretti, Letitia Wright, and Eric André. Like the first film, \"Sing 2\" features songs from many artists, most of which are performed diegetically.\\n\"Sing 2\" made its world premiere at the AFI Fest on November 14, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 22, 2021. The film was met with generally positive reviews and grossed over $408\\xa0million worldwide against a production budget of $85\\xa0million, becoming the highest-grossing animated film of 2021 and the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2021. A sequel is in development.\\nPlot.\\nBuster Moon is thriving with his newly rebuilt theater; Johnny, Meena, Rosita, Gunter, and Miss Crawly work as his cast and crew, while Ash performs as a soloist at Rick\\'s rock club. Buster\\'s show fails to impress Crystal Entertainment\\'s talent scout dog Suki Lane, who tells Buster he would not make it in Redshore City. Encouraged by Nana Noodleman, Buster rounds up his crew and they travel to the city to make an impression.\\nThey are denied entry into Crystal Entertainment but sneak in for an audition with entertainment mogul wolf Jimmy Crystal. As Jimmy is uninterested in Buster\\'s original show pitch, Gunter suggests a space-themed sci-fi musical called \"Out of This World\" that features songs from Clay Calloway, a legendary rock star lion who disappeared after his wife Ruby died 15 years prior. Intrigued, and assuming that Clay will be a part of the show, Jimmy greenlights it and lets Buster and his friends stay at his hotel during production.\\nMiss Crawly finds where Clay lives and goes to visit him, but he scares her away with a paintball gun. During rehearsal, Rosita reveals to have a fear of heights after discovering she needs to make a high jump, prompting Jimmy to insist Buster have his daughter Porsha play her part instead. Buster reluctantly writes Rosita a minor role. Top choreographer monkey Klaus Kickenklober is hired to teach Johnny to dance, but is unnecessarily harsh, causing Johnny to struggle and fall behind. Johnny later comes across a street dancer lynx named Nooshy, who takes over as his teacher. Meena is cast in a romantic scene with Darius, an egocentric actor yak, but is unable to act the part convincingly, having never been in love before. She later meets and falls in love with an ice cream vendor elephant named Alfonso. Jimmy eventually discovers that Buster never contacted Clay about the show and threatens to harm Buster if he does not deliver.\\nAsh and Buster visit Clay to convince him to be in the show. He refuses at first, finding it too emotionally painful to perform after his wife\\'s death, but Ash changes his mind. Back at the theater, Buster offers Porsha to switch roles with Rosita, as Porsha\\'s acting skills are poor. Porsha misunderstands about Buster firing her and sadly leaves the set. After news of the \"firing\" is broadcast on television, an outraged Jimmy nearly drops Buster off the roof of the hotel, before locking him in a closet. Suki frees Buster and warns him to get out of Redshore City before Jimmy can kill him. Ash arrives at the hotel room with the crew and Clay, who advises Buster not to run and hide as he did. After overhearing Jimmy insulting him and his crew on television, Buster decides to put on the show that night behind Jimmy\\'s back. Porsha rejoins the show, Johnny summons his father\\'s gang who are now released from prison on community service to keep Jimmy and his bodyguards at bay, and Rosita arranges for her husband Norman and their 25 children to distract hotel security.\\nDuring the show, a jealous Klaus takes the place of Johnny\\'s performance partner to undermine his number, but Johnny defeats Klaus with encouragement from Nooshy and the other dancers, finally earning Klaus\\' respect. Porsha performs a high-energy song and dance number in the minor role originally given to Rosita, standing up to her enraged father. Meena visualizes Darius as Alfonso and successfully performs a romantic duet with him. Making a final attempt to stop the show, Jimmy drops Buster from a catwalk, which forces Rosita to overcome her phobia and make the jump to rescue Buster. When the time comes for Clay to take the stage, he claims not ready yet. Ash leads the crowd in a rendition of one of Clay\\'s songs, giving him the courage to perform. After the curtain call, Jimmy tries to take credit for the successful show; however, Suki has him arrested.\\nSometime later, Buster and the crew set out to return to Calatonia, with Nooshy, Porsha, and Clay joining them. Suki stops them, and tells them that the Majestic, a major theater, wants to put on the show. As the crew performs, Buster watches from the VIP section.\\nVoice cast.\\nIn addition, Julia Davis voices Linda le Bon, a horse and host of \"Hot News\", while Spike Jonze has an uncredited voice role as Jerry, a cat who is Jimmy\\'s personal assistant.\\nAmongst the voices of Rosita and Norman\\'s piglets is Matthew McConaughey\\'s daughter, Vida Alves, who voices the piglet that goes splashing in chocolate. Director Jennings\\' wife, Louise, voices a dog worker making Meena\\'s costume for the show, while the couple\\'s four children, Asa, Caspar, Leo and Oscar, are among the piglet voices.\\nAs with the first film, Jennings\\' filmmaker friends Wes Anderson, Chris Renaud, and Edgar Wright all have cameos in the film, with Anderson as a tarsier night cleaner, Renaud as Linda Le Bon\\'s show announcer, and Wright voicing a dog cop and a pig chauffeur. Scott Mosier, director of \"The Grinch\" and the short film \"Eddie\\'s Life Coach\", voices Mason, a walrus worker making the sets for the show.\\nProduction.\\nOn January 25, 2017, Universal Pictures and Illumination announced a sequel to its 2016 animated film \"Sing\" was in development. Writer/director Garth Jennings and producers Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy return along with voiceover stars Matthew McConaughey, Reese Witherspoon, Scarlett Johansson, Nick Kroll, Taron Egerton and Tori Kelly.\\nIn December 2020, Bobby Cannavale, Letitia Wright, Eric André, Chelsea Peretti, longtime Illumination collaborator Pharrell Williams, Bono and Halsey were added to the voice cast. Work on the film shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was done remotely following the temporary closure of Illumination Mac Guff (now renamed as Illumination Studios Paris).\\nThe scope of the theatre in the finale was a major stepping stone to take over 10,000 animals for the crowd department, old and new ones designed by longtime Illumination artist Eric Guillon who worked on \"Sing\" and designed the new characters in the sequel like choreographer Klaus and the tarsiers. Fashion brand Rodarte designed some of the costumes used in the film.\\nMusic.\\nIn December 2020, Joby Talbot returned to compose the score. U2 performed the film\\'s original song \"Your Song Saved My Life\". The song was released on November 3, 2021. Additional music includes songs by Kiana Ledé, Sam i, Billie Eilish, Elton John and more. The film\\'s soundtrack was released on December 17, 2021.\\nRelease.\\nTheatrical and home media.\\n\"Sing 2\" had its world premiere, opening the AFI Fest Celebration on November 14, 2021, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 22, 2021, in RealD 3D, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, after previously being scheduled to be released in the United States on December 25, 2020, and July 2, 2021. Early access screenings occurred in the United States on November 27, 2021. The film was released to video on January 7, 2022, on platforms such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Vudu, Xfinity, and YouTube. It was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 29, 2022, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment.\\nMarketing.\\nTomy made a deal with Illumination and Universal to develop the \"Sing 2\" toy line, featuring plush toys, collectible figures, and a role-playing game. An \"Adopt Me!\" live event was released on Roblox by Uplift Games in partnership with Illumination to promote this film. The film also has many promotional partners including Xfinity, McDonald\\'s, Kellogg\\'s, and Mercari. By its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, the film had made 393.1\\xa0million impressions across all social media platforms, a statistic 24% above those of a film released before the COVID-19 pandemic.
